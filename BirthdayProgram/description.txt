Write a program to get user’s age and a boolean value to check if it’s his/her
birthday. 

If the user says it’s his birthday - increase his age by 1. 

Now,based on user’s age print just one statement by checking these
conditions:

1. If the user’s age is less than or equal to 18, print “User is 18 or
younger”
2. If user’s age is greater than 18 and less than 40, print “User is
between 19 and 39”
3. If user’s age is equal to either 45 or 50, print “User is either 45 or
50”
4. Otherwise, print “User is older than 40”
